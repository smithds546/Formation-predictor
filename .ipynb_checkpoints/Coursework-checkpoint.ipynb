    "## Goal\n",
    "The modern game of football has developed into an incredibly tactical game as opposed to what was being played 15 years ago. The first point of change was ever expanding types of formations that could be played, making it confusing for managers these days to cope with what is the best suited formation to counter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to build a regressive neural network that can predict the most effective formation for a team to use to counter the oppositions formation. To make this model effective it will consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Opponents formation\n",
    "> - Both teams current form with a certain formation\n",
    "> - Home vs Away teams\n",
    "> - Match outcomes\n",

    "## Related Work\n",
    "To begin predicting optimal football formations, it is key to understand team tactics and how they can influence match outcomes. The study by Lee & Jung (2023) explores this problem using deep neural networks to predict team tactics, making it an applicable study to assist in predicting an optimal formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than focusing solely on match outcomes, the paper proposes a multi-output deep neural network that attempts to infer underlying tactical strategies from a range of features. Player positions and movements are represented as structured inputs to the model, allowing tactical patterns to be learned directly from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach closely aligns with the methodology adopted in this tutorial, using features such as team formation, recent form, match venue and historical match outcomes. By doing so, the model aims to learn how formations perform under different contextual conditions and predict the most effective formation to counter an opponent."
